# Exception Handling Improvements

## Goals
- Enable GlobalExceptionHandler to work properly with UI pages  
- Clean separation between global exceptions and error controller
- Ensure BusinessExceptions are properly thrown and handled
- Comment out unused classes/methods

## Tasks

- [x] **Planning Phase**
  - [x] Analyze current exception handling setup
  - [x] Create implementation plan
  - [x] Get user approval

- [x] **Execution Phase**
  - [x] Enable GlobalExceptionHandler for MVC (not REST API)
  - [x] Add handler for BusinessException that redirects errors to UI
  - [x] Add handler for ResourceNotFoundException
  - [x] Comment out unused ApiError class (since this is MVC, not REST - was already commented)
  - [x] UI templates already have error display (th:if="${error}")
  - [x] Keep ErrorPageController for generic servlet errors (404, 500)

- [/] **Verification Phase**
  - [ ] Verify application compiles
  - [ ] Test business exception flows
